"""Generic codegen substrate shared by AOTAutograd's runtime wrappers.

Compiles a generated wrapper source string into a live function. This is the
single chokepoint every runtime-wrapper codegen routes through -- the subclass
wrappers in subclass_codegen.py and the orchestration / alias / mutation
epilogues in runtime_wrappers.py -- so it deliberately knows nothing about any
particular wrapper kind. Kept as a leaf module (stdlib + torch only) so it is
safe to import from anywhere in the package.
